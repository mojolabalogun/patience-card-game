PATIENCE | A single player game that tests your ability to wait for the right card.
The game is a version of the halting problem but instead of asking "Does the 
program terminate?", we ask, "Does your card exist in an infinite deck of 
cards?"

Game Instructions:
    - Pick one card that exists in a standard deck (e.g. Ace of Spades, 2 of Clubs)
    - Now, just wait! Every second a card will be printed to the screen.
        - If your card eventually shows up you win!
        - Otherwise, you can press 'enter' at any point in the game to stop the
        game. If you stop the game, and your card is not in the deck you win!
    - It's that simple :)

Running the Game:
    Go to the directory with the shell script (../patience) and run the following:
        >> ./patience
    Alternatively, you can run:
        >> python3 patience.py
